# *The thing is...*

*Conner is the one who is always being asked "Where is the Conner?" but rarely is he asked "How is the Conner?" He is not here, nor is he not there, rarely does he ever fair.*


*Between the light and darks, night and arcs, People look for his whereabouts, but they don't care for his fairabouts.*


*Conner might be feeling isolated, Just like a lost soul on the roam, far away from his home, While we look from morning till ovenoang, His heart is a mere gnome.*


*If we asked him, “How’s your day?” Conner’s fears might melt away, It’s the thought that counts everyday (bro wtdcf), Not just where his journey nays.*


*So next time, lend an ear to Conner, Ask him kindly, “How’s it going my home slice?” With compassion in your tone, We’ll find Conner never feels alone, kys.*
